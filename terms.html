<br/><br/>
<p>We welcome you to Talnote.com and we appreciate you using our site. When you use our Products and Services, you are agreeing to our terms, so please take a few minutes to read the User Agreement below.</p>
<p>Please note that you are entering into a legally binding agreement.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Introduction</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Our mission is to make Hiring simpler and more effective. We are a social hiring site and our products and services are designed towards making professionals and companies connect with each other in the most transparent and productive manner.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1&nbsp;&nbsp;Agreement</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You agree that by clicking on &ldquo;Sign Up&rdquo; or similar, registering, accessing or using our Site, you are entering a legally binding agreement (even if you are using our Site on behalf of a company). Irrespective where you reside, your agreement is with Resoneuronance Software Solutions Pvt. Ltd. Our Agreements may use Resoneuronance &nbsp;or Talnote interchangeably but they refer to the same entity.</p>
<p>This &ldquo;Agreement&rdquo; includes this User Agreement and the Privacy Policy may be amended by Talnote from time to time. If you do not agree to this Agreement, do NOT click on &ldquo;Sign Up&rdquo; (or similar) and do not access or otherwise use any of our Product or Services (used interchangeably but will cover both).</p>
<p>Registered users of our Services are &ldquo;Members&rdquo; and unregistered users are &ldquo;Visitors&rdquo;. This Agreement applies to both.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Obligations</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Here are some promises you make to us in this Agreement.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1&nbsp;&nbsp;Service Eligibility</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>To use the Services, you agree that: (1) you must be the &ldquo;Minimum Age&rdquo; (defined below) or older; (2) you will only have one Talnote account which must be in your real name; &ldquo;Minimum Age&rdquo; means 16 years old for all countries. However, if law requires that you must be older in order for Talnote to lawfully provide the Services to you (including the collection, storage and use of your information) then the Minimum Age is such older age. The Services are not for use by anyone under the age of 16.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>2&nbsp;&nbsp;Your Membership</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>As between you and others, your account belongs to you. You agree to: (1) try to choose a strong and secure password; (2) keep your password secure and confidential; (3) not transfer any part of your account (e.g., connections, postings) and (4) follow the law and the Dos and Don'ts below. You are responsible for anything that happens through your account unless you report misuse.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>3&nbsp;&nbsp;Notices and Service Messages</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You agree that we may provide notices to you in the following ways: (1) a banner notice on the Service, or (2) an email sent to an address you provided, or (3) through other means including mobile number, telephone, or mail. You agree to keep your contact information up to date.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>4&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharing of Personal contact Information</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The personal contact information is shared only when the job poster and job applicant both show interest and a handshake is complete. In this case both the job poster and the job seeker have their counterparts&rsquo; contact information currently in the form of phone no. and email Id.</p>
<p>We are not obligated to publish any information or content on our Service and can remove it in our sole discretion, with or without notice.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>5&nbsp;&nbsp;Compatibility</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>There is an algorithm in place that depending upon the skill set and experience calculates the job seekers&rsquo; eligibility for a particular job post. This is NOT a parameter to judge a job seeker. It&rsquo;s in place to help a job poster to filter candidates by relevancy. Talnote intends to keep this algorithm secret and not reveal its details under any circumstances to any of its users or visitors.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Rights and Limits</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>

These rights are limited in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can end this license for specific content by deleting such content from the Services, or generally by closing your account, except (a) to the extent you shared it with others as part of the Service and they copied or stored it and (b) for the reasonable time it takes to remove from backup and other systems.</li>

<li>While we may edit and make formatting changes to your content (such as translating it, modifying the size, layout or file type or removing metadata), we will try to not modify the meaning of your expression.</li>
<li>Because you own your content and information and we only have non-exclusive rights to it, you may choose to make it available to others</li>
</ul>
<p>You agree that we may access, store and use any information that you provide in accordance with the terms of the Privacy Policy and your settings.</p>

<li><strong>General Terms</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If a court with authority over this Agreement finds any part of it not enforceable, you and us agree that the court should modify the terms to make that part enforceable while still achieving its intent. If the court cannot do that, you and us agree to ask the court to remove that unenforceable part and still enforce the rest of this Agreement. This Agreement (including additional terms that may be provided by us when you engage with a feature of the Services) is the only agreement between us regarding the Services.</p>
<p>If we don't act to enforce a breach of this Agreement, that does not mean that Talnote has waived its right to enforce this Agreement. You may not assign or transfer this Agreement (or your membership or use of Services) to anyone without our consent. However, you agree that Talnote may assign this Agreement to its affiliates or a party that buys it without your consent. There are no third party beneficiaries to this Agreement.</p>
